Summary: This program allows the user to download images from a wireless enabled Olympus camera, leaving the originals on the SD card.

  OS:      Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 both working well, Mac OS not tested
  DevTool: Lazarus 2.06 / FPC3.04
  Camera: Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark I, Mark 3 tested working
  How it works: Main class TOiShareReader, inherted from a TfpHTTPClient component, manages connecion to the camera oer a wireless signal.
                The TfpHTTPClient is an component which is not installed in Lazarus by default and needs to be installed in the fpWeb library
                using Menu|Package!Install/Uninstall Packages.

  Why develop this program?  Olympus makes Android and iOS apps (Oi.Share) to allow WiFi download of images from their camera but do
  not have an app for PC, Mac or Linux desktops. While a web browser can be pointed at the camera URL, this is cumbersome, and automated
  downloading of image files is not possible using a web interfacem, or using the mobile and tablet Oishare app.
  Now that the previous EyeFi WiFi enabled SD cards are no longer maid, a WiFi connection for Windows, Linux and Mac is needed.

  'HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM  // TODO: need different EOL for Linux/macOS

     1.   Take some photos on your Olympus camera
     2.   Use the Olympus camera menu to select Connection to Smartphone.  This starts the camera WiFi server.
     3.   Connect your computer to this WiFi signal in the usual way for your operating system
     4.   Run this OlympusWIFI program
     5.   App Settings (Page 3): i)   Select your model of camera.  If your model is not there then use the Add button to add it.
                                 ii)  Ensure the "Olympus Camera Server URL" is set correctly.
                                      This is the same URL address minus the "/DCIM" you can type into a web browser to access your camera.
                                      Change the server URL if needed
                                      e.g. Model E-M10 Mark I URL = "http://oishare", Model E-M10 Mark III URL = "http://192.168.0.10"
                                 iii) Ensure the "SDCard Root Directory" is set correctly. This is usually "/DCIM". Need initial forward slash.
                                 iv)  Test your camera is connected with the "Test Camera Connection" button.
                                      If connected the text box below will fill with HTTP data from your camera.
                                      If not connected there will be no data.
                                      Save this HTTP data to file with the "Save Camera Data To File" button. This text file can be
                                      emailed to me at MSGEndoDoc@gmail.com so that I can improve the program.
     6.   App Transfer Images Page (Page 1)
                                 i)   Set the download directory ("Transfer Files to This Directory").  Camera images will end up here.
                                 ii)  Option 1: Press the grey triangle once to transfer images from camera to computer
                                      Option 2: Click the Repeat Timer checkbox and wait for the timer (e.g. 60s) to automate periodic image transfers.
     NOTE1:  Files downoaded will be remembered and not downloaded again on later transfers.
     NOTE2:  App Download History page (Page 2) lists all previously downloaded files.
             Deleting selected file records here will allow those images to be download again from the camera on later transfers.
     NOTE3:  The Download history is stored in the text file OlympusCameraDownloadRecord.txt.  Do not edit this file
     NOTE4:  The list of camera models with known connection URL are stroed in the ini file OlympusCameraModels.ini. Do not edit this file.
     NOTE5:  Have added a filename prefix box in the GUI on Page 1 so downloaded image filenames will be prefixed by whatever you 
             write in this box e.g. "Client John at Beach_300120_"   Note that you can not use char /,\,:,*,",<,>,| in filenames
